          <span>What are you supposed to do? You just need to do two things. First Send a picture or preferably a document of the homework that you were assigned and we will do the homework for you. The lowest grade out of all the main subjects you could possibly recieve from my work is a B nothing less. Now for the second thing you must do: I need a form of payment you may either pay through the website or if you are local you can pay face to face (no checks). All information given through the website is kept safe meaning no one, even I can see your credit card info. Your name name is released only to me. If you have any questions feel free to ask me through the Contact button on the bottom right corner of your screen!</span>
