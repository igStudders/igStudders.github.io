        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <span>We make the lives of students easier and less stressful by taking away the inconvenience of homework, so they can bedge and enjoy their lives. We calculate the small cost of doing your paper by the amount of time until it must be turned in, how many points the paper is worth, and finally the general subject of the paper (science, math, literature, etc.). The ensured minimum grade is also based off of the general subject, which you can view below.</span>
        <h3>Science >= B+</h3>
        <h3>Math >= A-</h3>
        <h3>Literature >= B</h3>
        <h3>Social Studies >= B</h3>
        <h3>Music >= B</h3>
        <h3>PE >= A (with study paper)</h3>
        <h3>Engineering >= B</h3>
        <h3>Tech >= A-</h3>
        <p>>= means more than or equal to</p>
        <p>IF YOU RECIEVE A GRADE LOWER THAN THE GRADE COORELATED WITH THE SUBJECT THEN YOU WILL GET A FULL REFUND AND FREE WORK ON THE NEXT PIECE OF HOMEWORK YOU WOULD LIKE. (Can Not Be A Project).</p>
